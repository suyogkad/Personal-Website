		<h1>Part 1</h1>
		<p>I first learned about web development when I was in seventh grade. I began by learning the fundamentals of HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). I was able to create a simple webpage using <i>html, paragraph, heading, marquee, and image tags</i> with the assistance of my computer tutor. I created a simple webpage describing my school where I inserted a photo of my school, used a marquee tag to slide a image across the webpage, used a background color, gave text a different color, described a few paragraphs and gave it the title "My School."</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that it was a simple webpage, it made me happy. As a result, I began to research website development. I was able to combine different webpages and create a website using HTML codes by the time I reached class ten.</p>
        <p>I began learning more about web development when I joined my bachelor's degree. I began learning more about HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). I learned how to design a webpage using CSS by using <i> tables, columns, rows, paragraphs, sections, images, buttons, icons, boxes, hyperlinks,</i> and many other elements. I was very excited at first, but as I began coding in HTML and CSS, it became more complex and difficult for me.</p>
        <p>I was bedridden for a month after contracting COVID-19 a few days before this project. As a result, I missed important updates, was unable to attend my online classes, was unable to communicate with my friends and teachers, and my life became more difficult. After about a month, I resumed working on it. To keep track of my project, I requested the assistance of my friends and watched numerous YouTube tutorials. I was on the verge of giving up because I was seeing so many new things and couldn't work around them. The codes I saw were complex, and the codes I implemented did not work properly.</p>
        <p>It was becoming increasingly difficult for me. So I drew a rough layout for my website in a blank sheet of paper and began coding accordingly. I drew a template-like thing and wrote codes for it. I used HTML to write the code and CSS to design the elements. Because I was using so many new codes, debugging took a long time for me. I had to search through several sections to find the error. I had to go through some web tutorials to debug it at times. Bugs that I couldn't fix on my own, I enlisted the assistance of my module leader and a few of my friends.</p>

			 	<p>Websites can be used in various fashions: a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites can be the work of an individual, a business or other organization, and are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose. Any website can contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived by the user, can be blurred.Some websites require user registration or subscription to access content. Examples of subscription websites include many business sites, news websites, academic journal websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, message boards, web-based email, social networking websites, websites providing real-time stock market data, as well as sites providing various other services.While "web site" was the original spelling (sometimes capitalized "Web site", since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web), this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as The Chicago Manual of Style[3] and the AP Stylebook,[4] have reflected this change. </p>
			 	<p>A static website is one that has web pages stored on the server in the format that is sent to a client web browser. It is primarily coded in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML); Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to control appearance beyond basic HTML. Images are commonly used to create the desired appearance and as part of the main content. Audio or video might also be considered "static" content if it plays automatically or is generally non-interactive. This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos, and other content and may require basic website design skills and software. Simple forms or marketing examples of websites, such as classic website, a five-page website or a brochure website are often static websites, because they present pre-defined, static information to the user. This may include information about a company and its products and services through text, photos, animations, audio/video, and navigation menus.Static websites may still use server side includes (SSI) as an editing convenience, such as sharing a common menu bar across many pages. As the site's behavior to the reader is still static, this is not considered a dynamic site.	</p>
