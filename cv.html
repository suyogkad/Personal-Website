			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>I am Suyog kadariya. ICT has been my passion from my childhood. I learnt my first programming langauge when I was 11 years. Since then, I enjoyed coding.

I have fully completed web designing training last year. I've worked as a teacher to teach python and php to senior college studets. I've worked as a web app developer in Startup Codes Lab.
